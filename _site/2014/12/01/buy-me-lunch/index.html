  <p>I get asked on a regular basis for advice, and I geniunely enjoy giving it. I love chatting with people to help them work through problems, especially as it relates to the design of technology products, be they websites, apps or other.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, over the years, my time has gotten more and more at a premium, and I’ve been able to do less and less consulting or other types of engagements where I can sit down and chat through problems with folks. </p>

<p>I want to change that. I eat lunch every day, and it makes sense to devote that time to helping other folks with their design and development problems. So, I’m kicking something off for the month of Decemeber: buy me lunch, and I’ll sit with you and chat through whatever you’re trying to solve. Easy enough.</p>

<p>In case you’re unfamiliar, my expertise is primarily in the UX arena, having nearly a decade of experience doing solely that. I’ve also created and launched countless sites and apps on my own, and can handle the development side of things pretty well also (particularly in the Javascript/Node area). Put simply, if you’re bringing some kind of tech product to market, I can probably help. </p>

<h3 id="i-like-lunch-where-do-i-sign-up">I Like Lunch. Where Do I Sign Up?</h3>

<p>So, interested in doing lunch? Let’s do this. I’ve chosen 5 restaurants nearby where I typically am during the day (in Ybor City, Tampa) - all you have to do is choose a spot and pick a day.</p>

<p>Here’s what you need to do:</p>

<ol>
  <li><a href="http://letsdolunch.youcanbook.me">Find a time and book me here</a></li>
  <li>Meet me there and buy lunch.</li>
</ol>

<p>That’s it!</p>

<p>Hope to see you out at lunch soon! I can’t wait to help you out with whatever you’re struggling through!</p>
