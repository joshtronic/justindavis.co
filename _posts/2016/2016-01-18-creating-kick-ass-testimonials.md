Earlier today, I was browsing various CRM vendors (including [a lament about Salesforce][tweet]), and went to check out [pipedrive][pipedrive]. Looking through the homepage, I came to the testimonials section. Here's what I saw:

Pretty standard testimonials section, except for one _huge thing_, it's personalized to me. I live in Tampa, FL, and they've pulled together testimonials - plus a bit of language about user adoption - for the state I live in.

This is legit. It makes the testimonials _much_ more effective, as they're much more personal. But, it gets better. That guy in the middle of the testimonials - Jonathan Cordeau - I KNOW THAT GUY. What better way to make testimonials incredibly effective than to tie it directly into your personal network? It's very persuasive.

As a bonus, I know _of_ the guy on the left, as I've heard about (and been at pitch events with) [Feathr][feathr].

Now, the fact that they've put names up there of folks might be a side effect of my involvement in the startup scene in Florida, and lucky chance that I know of two of these folks. That said, my hunch is that something more interesting is going on behind the scenes, and they're serving these people to me very intentionally.

And it works. Really, really well.

Here's the lesson: this kind of personalization is incredibly powerful. Yes, possibly creepy depending on your audience (I don't personally get freaked out about this stuff), but it's well worth considering.

Testimonials aren't the only thing you can personalize. Calls to action, color schemes, imagery - all that can be personalized based on what you know about the person currently viewing your site or app, and when done right, it's very seductive.

To me, this is what the web is about. The next iteration of the web isn't going to be another set of static sites that show the same thing to every user. Instead, it'll be a carefully crafted and personalized experience, designed to deliver as personal an experience as possible.

[Pipedrive][pipedrive] does a fantastic job of personalizing the experience in an automated way. What else have you seen? Leave it in the comments!
