I've always loved talk radio. You know, the shows where the radio host has
people call in, either with questions (ala [Car Talk][cartalk] or [The Dave Ramsey
Show][dave]), or topics to discuss (like every political or sports show out
there).

So, I've launched a podcast just like that, called [Design By Committee][dbc].
It's dedicated just to answering your questions and chatting about UX, product
design, content, strategy and anything else that has to do with tech. 

I'm joined on the show by my co-host, [Matthew Grocki][matt], one of the world's
foremost experts in content and digital strategy. Matt and I have both been
designing and building products for nearly 20 years, for companies that range
from small startups to the Fortune 10.

Now, we want to bring that expertise to you. Consider this your chance at a
little free consulting, or hell, just a chance to vent about some stuff you're
going through on your projects. Or, want an outsider's opinion you can bring a
recorded version of to your team? Gotcha covered.

## First Time, Long Time

Our show is powered by listener questions and discussion, so we can't do the
show without you. We want you to call in, chat with us, and help make this one
of the most interactive and fun podcasts about tech in the world.

To call in, simply dial 813-485-4866. You'll get a voicemail. Leave your
information, and we'll work with you to schedule you on the show. If you're not
the calling type, you can email us at [ask@dbcshow.com](mailto:ask@dbcshow.com),
and shoot us your questions there.
