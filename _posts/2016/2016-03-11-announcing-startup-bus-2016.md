For the past two years, I've subjected myself to a unique form of...education. In 2014 and 2015, I rode [StartupBus][sub] where I spent 72 hours building a startup and pitching in front of some of the [most][kawasaki] [influential][scoble] [people][birch] in technology in the country.

Now, this year, I'm helping lead the charge - I'm stoked to announce that I'm one of the conductors of this year's StartupBus, [leaving from Florida in May][sub].

## What is StartupBus?

For the initiated, StartupBus is an _intense_, 72-hour startup competition, where participants conceive of, build and launch a brand new company, pitching that company to some of the most influential folks in tech at the final destination. This yeah, that destination is Boulder, home of [TechStars][techstars], among many other companies involved in the startup scene.

StartupBus is different from other hackathons you might have been involved with in the past. First, the level of intensity is unlike anything you've experienced in the past. Everyone on the bus is forced to work at an extremely high level, with colleagues that are the best at their game. This isn't an experience for beginners - this is an experts-only ordeal.

The StartupBus network is also insane. Once you've participated, you're in the family, and that family has some pretty notable members. Folks from Google, Facebook, Twilio and other leading tech companies can all call themselves Buspreneurs. That network lives with you past the bus, for years, creating the opportunity for mentorship and career advancement that's unparalelled. Trust me when I say you want to be in this club. It's exclusive, and it's incredibly high quality. 

In short, StartupBus is the pinnacle of startup and hackathon events. If you've done hackathons in the past, forget what you know. This is unlike anything you've experienced before. 

## What to Expect from Florida

This year, I'm super excited to help conduct the Florida bus. For the first time in StartupBus history, each bus has a theme, and our theme is food and beverage tech (what we're casually calling "The Beer Bus"). Florida (and Tampa Bay especially) is a hotbed of craft breweries and one of the leading restaurant and hospitality scenes in the country. We've got a [number][menupad] [of][osi] [local][fusionprep] companies in this space, and I'm super excited to put together an entire bus around this theme. Oh, and we'll make sure there's plenty of beer and goodies to accompany us on the ride to Boulder.

## How to Get Involved

Curious? Want to be part of this life-changing, incredible adventure? I'd love to have you as part of the bus. We're looking to fill the bus with 30 people, broadly in three groups: Hipsters (designers, etc.), Hustlers (sales, biz dev folks, etc.) and Hackers (devs, obvs). If you think you've got what it takes, and want to be part of an completely ridiculous, incredibly intense, game-changing experience, [apply for the competition now][sub] using the invite code **justin**. I can't wait to see you on the bus. 

We also need sponsors. We need to cover the cost of the bus and getting to Boulder, and the application fee doesn't get us there (we keep this as low as possible and subsidize with sponsorship). If you want to sponsor this incredible journey, definitely [get in touch][email] with me, I'd love to chat about how to get you involved and in front of the national audience that StartupBus draws.

## You Want To Do This

Excited? Let's do this! [Apply now][sub] to be part of this incredible experience. I can guarantee it'll be one of the best decisions you make this year.
