I'm a user experience designer and Javascript/Node dev, living in Tampa. I've currently got a handful of things rocking:

- [Madera Labs](http://www.maderalabs.com) - A User Experience Design Agency based in Tampa, FL.
- [Drawer](http://www.getdrawer.com) - An app for sharing collections of your favorite places with the world.

This blog is mostly rants, tips, thoughts and other random musings that are too long for Twitter and not quite appropriate for Facebook.

Btw, [follow me on Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/jwd2a).
