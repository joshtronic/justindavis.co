Today, [CrowdSync][cs], a company I've co-founded with [Josh Sherman][joshtronic] is
officially in open beta. 

This is the most exciting thing I've worked on to date.

## What is CrowdSync?

CrowdSync helps you automate paperwork, communications and logistics when
dealing with groups of people. If you're onboarding people into a class, trying
to distribute information to a large group, or doing anything else where you're
sending or requesting the same information from a group of people, CrowdSync can
save you hours, or days, of time. 

## Why is this so big?

CrowdSync is one of the first platforms of its kind that lets people build
workflows to automate repetitive manual tasks with groups. These tasks today can
cost companies thousands of dollars a month in manual tasks: copying the same
email and attaching the same documents for every new hire, or requesting every
student to fill out the same allergy form. Whatever the use case, it's a
horribly manual process that's prone to error. Until today. 

## How does it work?

Check out the [blog post][cslaunchpost] we wrote about how exactly CrowdSync works. In
short, we let you create workflows of actions (like, sending emails, requesting
forms to be completed, sending/receiving payments, etc), and add groups of
people to those workflows. We'll track them through the process, reminding them
along the way. All automatically. 

## Special offer to my readers!

From now through December 1, 2017, the beta of [CrowdSync][cs] is COMPLETELY FREE.
After that, the price will go up to $49/mo, for unlimited workflows.

But, if you want to lock in a crazy good deal, check this out. You can hit us up
before December 1st, and we'll lock you in at $19/mo FOR LIFE. That's right -
you'll never pay any more than that to use CrowdSync, for as long as you want. 

If you want to take advantage of this, [hit us up here][csoffer].

So, I definitely encourage you to [go give the beta a spin][cssignup] and make
sure to read [our blog post][cslaunchpost] about what to expect from it in the
next few months. We're just getting started, to say the least.
