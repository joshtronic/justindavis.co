I recently upgraded my monitor situation at the house, moving from a 37″ VISIO TV (I know, right?) to a set of dual 27″ monitors. I was looking for something with higher resolution, and also wanted the dual setup to give me more space for working.

My first thought was to jump on a pair of Apple Thunderbolt displays, but at $1K a pop, it was a little outside of the budget. Instead, I looked around and landed on a pair of ASUS PB278Q Monitors. Let me tell you, they’re pretty incredible, and at over half the price of a Thunderbolt display, they’re a perfect option if you’re not up for dropping all that coin.

I’ve been running this setup for a day now, here’s how things look:

The monitors have super crisp graphics, and are a great substitute for the Retina display on the Macbook Pro that I’m running things from. I currently have one running on HDMI straight from the computer, and the other on DisplayPort. I’ll probably eventually go with both on DisplayPort, just to make things consistent.

As for specs, here’s how things look:

- Screen size: 27′
- Aspect Ratio: 16:9
- Max resolution: 2560×1400
- WQHD support
- Accepts VGA, Dual-Link DVI, HDMI 1.4, DisplayPort 1.2
- Tilt, vertical movement and base rotation for adjusting the viewing angle

All in all, I’m damn happy with them. My only real gripe is that you can’t daisy chain them with DisplayPort, which means you’ll need a splitter or two ports to run them. Not a huge deal either way. BTW, if you buy one, don’t forget your [Mini DisplayPort to DisplayPort adapter](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00HNF0KF0/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00HNF0KF0&linkCode=as2&tag=daondr-20&linkId=SPSYI55ES45PP6QW) or [cable](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00C7RJQPY/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00C7RJQPY&linkCode=as2&tag=daondr-20&linkId=42T3EEL5UVL4KSPJ)!

A couple other shots of the monitors, to give you a full feel for them:

I’d highly recommend you take a look at them if you’re looking to upgrade your setup. One would be awesome, two is just incredible. At about $450/monitor they’re less than half the price of the Thunderbolt Displays, but definitely don’t leave you wanting.

Grab them on Amazon here:
