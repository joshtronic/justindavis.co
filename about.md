I'm the co-founder of [CrowdSync][cs], a platform to help you automate all the
work that comes with putting a bunch of people through the same process or
workflow.

I love bourbon, boats, Florida and tech. Oh, and my family, they're pretty cool
too.

This blog is mostly rants, tips, thoughts and other random musings that are too long for Twitter and not quite appropriate for Facebook.

Btw, [follow me on Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/jwd2a).
