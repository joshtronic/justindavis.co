The past few weeks, I've been making a loaf of sandwich bread every week to use for sandwiches at lunch. I love baking bread, and this is a chance to make some every week that makes for much better sandwiches, and lets me get some weekly practice in.

That said, there's only one downside to homemade bread: it stales quickly. Like, in 3-4 days. As I typically don't eat a full loaf every 3-4 days, I was stuck with half-loaves of stale bread. Then it hit me - make croutons out of the leftovers!

Making croutons is dead simple, and they're so much better than what you'd buy in-store. You can make these with ANY bread, but I'd recommend making your own bread, because homemade is always better :)

Here's how to do it:

## Cut up your loaf into crouton-sized chunks

Easy enough. Just cut up the break into cubes, whatever size you like for your croutons. They'll shrink a bit in the oven, so you might err on the larger size.

## Toss in oil or butter and spices

After you've got your bread cut into chunks, toss in a large bowl with enough oil or butter to coat them. They don't need to be soaked, but enough to where spices will stick to them. I use olive oil, but butter is just as good. 

Once you've got them somewhat coated, toss them in your spices. Feel free to be as creative as you want here! I generally use salt, pepper, italian seasoning, and perhaps some garlic and onion powder. Let your imagination run wild here (cayenne croutons, anyone?).

Protip: toss gently! We're talking about bread here, and the more rough you are with it, the more it'll break apart. Be gentle.

## Bake at 350f for 12-15 minutes

Once your croutons are nicely coated, lay them out in a single layer in a baking sheet, and stick in the oven for 12-15 minutes at 350. Make sure to watch them, because the difference between perfectly toasted and little chunks of charcoal is closer than you think. 

## Enjoy!

Toss your croutons on your favorite salad, and enjoy! You've created some of the best croutons you'll ever have and made great use of a loaf of bread you'd otherwise throw out!
