If you're a blogger, you probably struggle to blog as often as you should. You 
figure that a post a month is probably fine. 

Well, it's not. The more often you blog, the more you're able to sustain your 
audience. Here's the proof:

Until [my post yesterday about being a better dev][lint], I hadn't blogged since 
late July (when I wrote about [everyone being self employed][self]). August was busy, excuses, excuses. 

Check out the analytics:

![analytics][analytics]

A nice, consistent trend of about 2K users per month reading my blog, and them 
whammo, lost 25% of my audience as soon as I stopped posting. Hopefully 
(as it appears), starting up regularly again will get me back to where I need to be.

Let this be a lesson: blogging is like driving a car, as soon as you take your foot
off the accelerator, you start to slow down. Sure, you can coast for awhile, but
you'll eventually slow down, and getting back up to speed is going to take more
effort. 

If you're blogging, do it regularly, and watch your audience continue to pile up.
