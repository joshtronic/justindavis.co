Coming this fall, Apple will release OS X Yosemite, their new version of the OS X line.  Among the changes – notably the user interface, which I’m still trying to adjust to – is a big change to the notification center, which provides much more of an iOS7/8 type view:

This is undoubtedly a nice upgrade, and ushers in what I think will be the next big era of apps: notification widgets. The current set of widgets is, well, a bit limited. Some social stuff, weather, stock prices – the usual. Imagine, however, when this is opened up to developers. Some things I can think of that I’d love to see:

- Techcrunch Headlines
- Google Analytics
- Server Monitoring
- Places in [Drawer](http://www.getdrawer.com) I still need to try
- Weather Radar

There’s a lot that can be done with this space. With Apple [making notifications interactive on iOS8](http://www.imore.com/interactive-notifications-ios-8-explained), I think it’s a matter of time before we see full-on programmatic access to the notification center, with notification apps becoming as big a part of our behavior as phone apps.

What do you think? Do you agree that it’s a matter of time before Apple opens this up? Or do you think they’ll keep it to themselves? What apps would you want in the notification center?
