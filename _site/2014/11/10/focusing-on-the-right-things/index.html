  <p>I see this happen all the time. Someone launches their entrepreneural journey, thrusting themselves out into the world to hang a shingle and try to create something of their own.</p>

<p>Then, shit gets messy.</p>

<p>They start worrying about letterheads, buying t-shirts and other swag, getting nicer chairs for the office and a myriad of other time-wasting tasks. More often than not, what’s left of the startup is a box of t-shirts in the corner.</p>

<p>Let’s be real clear on one thing: anything that doesn’t <em>directly</em> lead to customers trasacting with you is a waste of time in those early days. In those early days, cash is at a premium, and your entire goal is to get a product into the market and find out if people want it.</p>

<p>That’s it. You’re not building a brand here. You’re not changing the world, yet. You’re trying to get the first 10 people to say that what you’re doing is valuable. </p>

<p>This is such an amateur mistake, and it’s easy to spot people who’ve never built anything before based on these activities. Do yourself a favor, stop doing anything that isn’t directly about building and delivering product to your customers. That’s it. </p>

<p>In case you need a reminder, here’s what you should be doing in the early days of your startup:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Building product</li>
  <li>Shipping product</li>
  <li>Talking to customers</li>
</ul>

<p>That’s it. Note that there’s nothing in there about window treatments, coffee machines and stickers. Starting a company is ridiculously hard work, you don’t have the luxury to waste resources at this point - start focusing relentlessly on those above bullet points, and cut everything else out.  </p>
