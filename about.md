I'm a user experience designer and Javascript/Node dev, living in Tampa. I've currently got a handful of things rocking:

- [Madera Labs](http://www.maderalabs.com) - A User Experience Design Agency
- [Drawer](http://www.getdrawer.com) - An app for sharing collections of your favorite places with the world.
- Also, an instructor at [gr8code](http://www.gr8code.com) - a coding bootcamp in Tampa.

This blog is mostly rants, tips, thoughts and other random musings that are too long for Twitter and not quite appropriate for Facebook.

Btw, [follow me on Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/jwd2a).
